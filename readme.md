## General info
This project is a website meant to save and organize tasks. With the Work Day Scheduler, users are able to see the current date as well as time blocks from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., the typical work day hours. Upon clicking on a time slot, you can type in a task and have it saved for that slot even as the page reloads. Another unique feature of this website, is it is colorcoded to show whether a time slot has already passed, is currently happening, or will occur later in the future.
